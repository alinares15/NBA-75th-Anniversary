        <h1>G League</h1>

        <div>

            <p>
                The NBA G League or the G league is the National Basketball Association's official
                minor league. The league started with eight teams until NBA comissioner announced a plan
                to expand the league to fifthteen teams and develop it into a true minor league farm
                system. Each team in the league would be affiliated with one or more NBA teams in March 2005.
                At the conclusion of the 2013–14 NBA season, 33% of NBA players had spent time in the NBA D-League,
                up from 23% in 2011. As of the 2018–19 season, the league consists of 27 teams, all of which are either
                single-affiliated or owned by an NBA team.
            </p>

            <h5>The National Basketball Development League (2001-2005)</h5>

            <p>
                The league began it's play as the National Basketball Development League (NBDL) in the
                2001-02 season. The originally eight franchises were all located in Virgina, North Carolina,
                South Carolina, Alabama, and Georgia.

            </p>

            <h5>NBA Development League (2005-2017)</h5>

            <p>
                In 2005 the leauge's name was changed to the NBA Development League (NBA D-League) as part of the new collective
                bargaining agreement with the NBA and a bid to appeal to more fans by showing their connection to the major league.
                In the same offseason, Southwest Basketball, LLC led by David Kahn was granted permission by the league to operate four new teams.
                Southwest Basketball then purchased three existing franchises and one expansion team: the Albuquerque Thunderbirds, Austin Toros,
                Fort Worth Flyers and the Tulsa 66ers. The Arkansas RimRockers were also added from the ABA for the 2005–06 season. In February 2006,
                the D-League expanded to California for the first time with the addition of the Bakersfield Jam.
            </p>

            <p>
                Two months later, the league announced that four teams from the Continental Basketball Association were joining the league: the Dakota Wizards,
                Sioux Falls Skyforce, Idaho Stampede, and a team originally slated for CBA expansion, the Colorado 14ers. Shortly after, the league announced
                expansion teams in the Anaheim Arsenal and the Los Angeles D-Fenders. The D-Fenders became the first D-League team to be directly owned by an
                NBA parent team, the Los Angeles Lakers.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2009, the Houston Rockets entered into the first single-affiliation partnership, called the hybrid model, with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers.
                This began a wave of NBA and D-League teams entering into single-affiliation agreements of both the hybrid and parent-team owned varieties.
                With more NBA involvement, the league once again began to expand and spread its footprint. By 2015, the last multiple-affiliate team, the
                Fort Wayne Mad Ants, was purchased by the Indiana Pacers leading to the first season where all D-League teams were affiliated with only one NBA team.
                As there were no longer any unaffiliated D-League teams left, the remaining NBA teams began purchasing expansion franchises or hybrid partnership teams
                and placing them near the parent team. In 2015, the Toronto Raptors placed their own team, Raptors 905, in the Greater Toronto Area in Mississauga, Ontario.
                In 2016, the D-League expanded by three more NBA parent club-owned teams for the largest D-League expansion since 2007. The Charlotte Hornets created
                the Greensboro Swarm, the Brooklyn Nets created the Long Island Nets, and the Chicago Bulls created the Windy City Bulls.

            <h5>NBA G League (2017–present)</h5>

            <p>
                In the 2017–18 season, the D-League entered into a multi-year partnership with Gatorade and announced it would be rebranded as the NBA Gatorade League,
                which was officially shortened to "NBA G League" prior to the season.It also continued its membership changes with the relocation of the Erie BayHawks
                to Lakeland, Florida, as the Lakeland Magic, a new Erie BayHawks franchise; and expansions in the Agua Caliente Clippers in Ontario, California; the Memphis Hustle
                in Southaven, Mississippi; and the Wisconsin Herd in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The Los Angeles D-Fenders would also re-brand to the South Bay Lakers to reflect the league name change.
            </p>

            <p>
                In December 2017, the NBA and the live streaming website Twitch announced that they would broadcast G League games on Twitch.tv. ESPN U, ESPNews, and ESPN2 also aired some 2017–18
                regular season and playoff games.Games have also been aired on the ESPN Plus subscription service.For the 2019–20 season, the G League will begin to offer Select Contracts
                to players that are not yet eligible to enter the NBA Draft.Since 2006, players that are not at least 19 years old by the end
                of the calendar year have been ineligible, creating what became known as the "one-and-done" rule where players joined a college basketball team for one season and then leave for the NBA.The new Select
                Contract is to be an alternative for players who do not want to or cannot attend a college, worth up to $125,000 for a season.
